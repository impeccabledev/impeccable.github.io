            Udaipur branch ended the financial year with a happy note of nil NPA (Non Performing Asset) with
            their consistent efforts by strictly following the fixed bill dates without any slippages.
        <p>

        <p>
            The branch had the peak NPA stock of & 96 lakhs and 29 contracts were contributing to the NPA
            stock. Sharp focus and timely actions on each contract helped the branch to achieve nil NPA. The
            unique aspect is the genuine customers were given one or two months time or even part payment
            option if they were unable to pay on the due date and this is the typcial Sundaram Way!

        <h4>
            Here are the strategies of how they managed their receivables:
        </h4>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Primary focus on deliquent customers. The team were firm that we should get our rightful money
                back thus exhibiting a strong ownership in them
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Early detection of problematic contracts and early action was the key to great collection performance
            </li>

            <li>
                Day to day follow up, FBD (Fixed Billing Date) wise follow up, daily reminders helped them in not adding new NPA
            </li>

            <li>
                Slippages were not allowed in the current collection
            </li>

            <li>
                Branch manager used to visit every customer whose contract fell in 60 DPD (Days Passed Due).
            </li>
    
            <li>
                Advised the customer to update payment through quick pay on a daily basis. Also educated the cus-
                tomer on CIBIL, importance of good credit score and additional AFC (Annual Finance Charges) in
                case of late payment.
            </li>
            <li>
                60 DPD and PA list were prepared customer wise and team chased them regularly to update
            </li>
            <li>
                Every NTC (New To Credit) contract and hard core NPA were followed critically to collect it on FBD
            </li>
            <li>
                Chronic cases were handled in an unique way. Once in a week the entire team visited the customer
                to request for payment. This made the customer to realise the seriousness of the problem. Thus by
                creating pressure on the customer, they resolved maximum chronic cases
            </li>
            <li>
                For customers who don't have the intention to repay, with the help of recovery agent, we repossed
                the vehicles on time.
            </li>
            <li>
                For cases where the vehicles were not traceable, we investigated, engaged repo agent, made joint
                visits with police to customer place to resolve the issue
            </li>
            <li>
                After the repossesion of vehicles, we got valuation report, gave paper ads and circulated the vehi-
                cle details to all our prospective buyers to get the best quotation. If we received a higher price, we
                gave the extra amount to the respective customers.
            </li>
        </ul>
