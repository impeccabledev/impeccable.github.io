            Sri Venkateswarlu Pachava was our commercial vehicle customer who had availed a loan of 233.5
            lakhs for one vehicle and 230 lakhs for the second vehicle. When the vehicles carried dues of 25.49
            lakhs and 27.21 lakhs respectively, he stopped repayment and accounts fell into NPA (Non-Perform-
            ing Asset). Miryalguda team's repeated efforts to get him to clear the dues did not yield results. We
            even came to know that he had sold our vehicles without our knowledge.

            As a follow-up, we informed our repossession agents who unfortunately, could also not trace the ve-
            hicles. One fine day, our branch manager got some hint that one of the vehicles carrying some load,
            was coming through a petrol bunk in the highway. The branch manager with his team swung into
            action by starting off in the wee hours, looking out for the vehicle in the highway. When they came to
            a petrol station at 6 am, the vehicle was there for felling. At first, they could not identify it, as the
            number plate had been changed. But the sheer vigilance of our branch manager helped him to identi-
            fy the vehicle by spotting the transporter's company name written on the vehicle. Immediately they
            approached the vehicle and after unloading the chemicals, they took it to our yard.

            With the same spirit, the team repossessed the second vehicle of the defaulter the very next day!.

                This is excellent repossession. Waiting at morning 3 am in
                highway and identifying the vehicle with name. Even our Repo
                agent will not do this.
